                    Our community supports circular fashion and our members help tackle waste by bringing new life to pre-owned items. We want
                    to be the preferred secondhand fashion destination and in order to be that we have to bring the best supply of designer
                    pieces in front of our global community. You can join in and take part in our mission if you’re a boutique, brand,
                    marketplace, store or stock supplier.

                <h5>ACCESS TO OUR GROWING COMMUNITY</h5>
                <p>The Vintage Bar has various platforms and social channels – most notably our Instagram with more than 600k followers – and as a partner on The Vintage Bar your items will be included in the content we produce and showcase on these platforms.</p>
                <h5>GET BRANDING THROUGH OUR UNIVERSE</h5>
                <p>
We use branding in order to create an inspiring universe for our community and to make secondhand shopping cool and luxurious. As a partner on the platform you’ll be included in this as we’ll promote your boutique and pieces in the same way we do our own. </p>
                <h5>CONNECTING LOCAL SUPPLY WITH GLOBAL DEMAND</h5>
                <p>
Partnering with a marketplace with a global community that also provides worldwide shipping makes it possible for your boutique to expand and reach new target groups that previously weren’t able to shop with you.</p>
